# PIM_NDP_papers
This page contains a survey of Process-In-Memory (PIM) and Near-Data-Processing (NDP) papers. 
To distinguish between PIM and NDP (**from technology perspective**), we assume that PIM architecture either involves analog computation using memory array, or incorparating digital computing logic and memory components on the same die; 
whereas NDP architecture has seperate implementations of computing logic and memory components in different dies. Therefore in our categorization, recent 3D stacking based design belongs to NDP architecture.

**From an architecture perspective**, although some hardware uses memory technology to implement computation, they are still used as an accelerator for the host (for example, attached to PCIe as a slave device). These hardware designs assume separate physical address space from the host processor, and kenerl execution is similar to GPU (data copy-->kernel launch-->finish computation-->data copy). In contrast, some designs, though categorized as "NDP" in our survey, are truly "process-in-memory" from architectural standpoint. For example, "HMC + logic layer" can be used as memory device (read and written by the host) and a computation device (computation offloading). Also, some designs that have relatively large on-chip managed memory (For example, GPU has scratchpad memory, and DianNao has eDRAM) should be categorized as "memory-rich processor". These memory are local to the processor, and have no computing capability, so we do not include these papers in our survey.

We only include circuit, architecture and system level researches (The list is expected to grow as we add more new / dated papers).

Granularity: single instruction<br/>
Previous work: PIM-enabled instructions [ISCA 2015] require programmers to explicitly invoke PIM operations using new host (native) instructions. **GraphPIM does not add an extra burden on application programmers by leveraging existing host instructions.** <br/>
Key idea: map host atomic instructions directly into PIM atomics using uncacheable memory support in modern architectures, without any changes in user applications or ISA.<br/>
Offloading Target: choose the atomic operations on the graph property as PIM offloading targets. All host atomic instructions accessing the PMR (PIM memory region) are offloaded as PIMAtomic requests.<br/>
Takeaway: offloading with HMC-atomic instructions on CPU is beneficial for graph-computing applications. GraphPIM does not explore candidate properties and selection process.<br/>
Coherence Issue: GraphPIM requires the framework to allocate the graph property in the PIM memory region (PMR), which is a continuous block of an uncacheable region in the virtual memory space.<br/>

Granularity: Singel instruction<br/>
Idea: This paper is a a follow-up to GraphPIM. It extends GraphPIM to GPU workloads and introduces a compiler-assisted technique that facilitates instruction-level offloading on both CPU and GPU platforms in the context of HMC-atomic instructions for graph-computing applications.<br/>
Cache Coherence: Because HMC-atomic instructions directly modify data within the HMC, this design maintains a cache-bypassing policy that ensures a coherent view of offloading targets. In other words, marking the memory accesses of HMC-atomic instructions as uncacheable causes them to bypass the cache hierarchy and ensures that a single copy of offloading targets exists.<br/>
The cost metrics (bandwidth saving) to identify off-loading computation is similar to **Transparent Offloading and Mapping (TOM), (ISCA 2016)**.<br/>

Granularity: instruction blocks (GPU warp).<br/>
This paper assumes memory accessed by offloaded instructions are marked uncacheable. In other word, if a warp accesses memory that will cause data sharing among PIM and host, the warp should not be an offloading candidate.<br/>
This paper also assumes no memory barrier, synchronization, or atomic instructions in candidate blocks as it does not support synchronization primitives between the main GPU and the logic layer SM.<br/>
This paper assumes PIM cores to be streaming multiprocessor style to utilize the internal bandwidth of HMC.<br/>
This paper uses a compiler-based technique to identify candidate off-loading code blocks (bandwidth saving as a metric).<br/>
This paper also considers the problem of mapping data onto different HMCs (locality of data and computation). This maps memory pages accessed by offloaded code to where the code will execute, by exploiting common memory access patterns.<br/>
This paper also discusses a runtime component to dynamically determine whether an offloading candidate block should really be offloaded.<br/>
Virtual memory mechanism: this paper assumes memory stack SMs are equipped with similar TLBs and MMUs and are capable of performing virtual address translation. It assumes the size of the MMU and TLB per SM is fairly small: 1-2K flip-flops and small amount of logic.<br/>
