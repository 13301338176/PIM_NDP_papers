# PIM_NDP_papers
This page contains a survey of Process-In-Memory (PIM) and Near-Data-Processing (NDP) papers. 
To distinguish between PIM and NDP, we assume that PIM architecture either involves analog computation using memory array, or incorparating digital computing logic and memory components on the same die; 
whereas NDP architecture has seperate implementations of computing logic and memory components in different dies. Therefore in our categorization, recent 3D stacking based design belongs to NDP architecture.
