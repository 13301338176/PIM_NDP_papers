Granularity: single instruction<br/>
Previous work: PIM-enabled instructions [ISCA 2015] require programmers to explicitly invoke PIM operations using new host (native) instructions. **GraphPIM does not add an extra burden on application programmers by leveraging existing host instructions.** <br/>
Key idea: map host atomic instructions directly into PIM atomics using uncacheable memory support in modern architectures, without any changes in user applications or ISA.<br/>
Offloading Target: choose the atomic operations on the graph property as PIM offloading targets. All host atomic instructions accessing the PMR (PIM memory region) are offloaded as PIMAtomic requests.<br/>
Takeaway: offloading with HMC-atomic instructions on CPU is beneficial for graph-computing applications. GraphPIM does not explore candidate properties and selection process.<br/>
Coherence Issue: GraphPIM requires the framework to allocate the graph property in the PIM memory region (PMR), which is a continuous block of an uncacheable region in the virtual memory space.<br/>

"These works (1) are often unable to take advantage of the high internal bandwidth of 3D-stacked DRAM, which reduces the efficiency of PIM execution, and (2) may still suffer from many of the same challenges faced by architectures that embed logic within the DRAM chip." - Ghose, arXiv 2018.<br/>

Granularity: Singel instruction<br/>
Idea: This paper is a a follow-up to GraphPIM. It extends GraphPIM to GPU workloads and introduces a compiler-assisted technique that facilitates instruction-level offloading on both CPU and GPU platforms in the context of HMC-atomic instructions for graph-computing applications.<br/>
Cache Coherence: Because HMC-atomic instructions directly modify data within the HMC, this design maintains a cache-bypassing policy that ensures a coherent view of offloading targets. In other words, marking the memory accesses of HMC-atomic instructions as uncacheable causes them to bypass the cache hierarchy and ensures that a single copy of offloading targets exists.<br/>
The cost metrics (bandwidth saving) to identify off-loading computation is similar to **Transparent Offloading and Mapping (TOM), (ISCA 2016)**.<br/>

Granularity: instruction blocks (GPU warp).<br/>
This paper assumes memory accessed by offloaded instructions are marked uncacheable. In other word, if a warp accesses memory that will cause data sharing among PIM and host, the warp should not be an offloading candidate.<br/>
This paper also assumes no memory barrier, synchronization, or atomic instructions in candidate blocks as it does not support synchronization primitives between the main GPU and the logic layer SM.<br/>
This paper assumes PIM cores to be streaming multiprocessor style to utilize the internal bandwidth of HMC.<br/>
This paper uses a compiler-based technique to identify candidate off-loading code blocks (bandwidth saving as a metric).<br/>
This paper also considers the problem of mapping data onto different HMCs (locality of data and computation). This maps memory pages accessed by offloaded code to where the code will execute, by exploiting common memory access patterns.<br/>
This paper also discusses a runtime component to dynamically determine whether an offloading candidate block should really be offloaded.<br/>
Virtual memory mechanism: this paper assumes memory stack SMs are equipped with similar TLBs and MMUs and are capable of performing virtual address translation. It assumes the size of the MMU and TLB per SM is fairly small: 1-2K flip-flops and small amount of logic.<br/>
